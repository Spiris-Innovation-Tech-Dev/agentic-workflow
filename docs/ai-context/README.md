# AI Context Documentation

This directory contains documentation specifically written for AI agents working with the agentic-workflow codebase. Unlike user-facing docs, these focus on implementation details, patterns, and gotchas that help AI agents make good decisions.

## Available Documentation

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [memory-preservation.md](./memory-preservation.md) | How to save/retrieve discoveries across context compaction |

## When to Read These Docs

- **Starting a new task** - Check for relevant patterns before planning
- **After context compaction** - Reload discoveries, review patterns
- **Implementing features** - Understand conventions and constraints
- **Debugging issues** - Check for known gotchas

## For Technical Writers

When documenting new features or patterns, consider:

1. **Is this AI-specific?** - Does it help AI agents but not necessarily human developers?
2. **Is it non-obvious?** - Would an AI without this context make mistakes?
3. **Is it a pattern?** - Is it something that should be consistent across the codebase?

If yes to any, add it to this directory.

### Document Structure

Each document should include:
- **What problem it solves** - Why does this exist?
- **How to use it** - Concrete examples with tool calls
- **When to use it** - Decision criteria
- **Common mistakes** - What to avoid

## MCP Tools Reference

The agentic-workflow MCP server provides tools for AI agents. Key tool groups:

### Memory & Context
- `workflow_save_discovery` - Save learnings
- `workflow_get_discoveries` - Retrieve learnings
- `workflow_flush_context` - Get all learnings for reload (superseded by compaction when enabled)
- `workflow_search_memories` - Search across tasks
- `workflow_get_context_usage` - Check context pressure
- `workflow_prune_old_outputs` - Clean up old files

### Workflow State
- `workflow_initialize` - Start a new workflow
- `workflow_transition` - Move between phases
- `workflow_get_state` - Get current state
- `workflow_complete_phase` - Mark phase done

### Workflow Modes & Effort
- `workflow_detect_mode` - Auto-detect mode from task description
- `workflow_set_mode` / `workflow_get_mode` - Set/get workflow mode (full/turbo/fast/minimal)
- `workflow_is_phase_in_mode` - Check if a phase runs in current mode
- `workflow_get_effort_level` - Get recommended thinking depth for an agent

### Cost Tracking
- `workflow_record_cost` - Record token usage (input, output, compaction tokens)
- `workflow_get_cost_summary` - Get cost breakdown by agent and model

### Agent Teams (Experimental)
- `workflow_get_agent_team_config` - Check if agent teams are enabled for a feature (`parallel_review`, `parallel_implementation`)

### Parallelization
- `workflow_start_parallel_phase` - Start parallel agent execution
- `workflow_complete_parallel_phase` - Mark a parallel phase done
- `workflow_merge_parallel_results` - Merge and deduplicate parallel results

### Task Linking
- `workflow_link_tasks` - Connect related tasks
- `workflow_get_linked_tasks` - Find related tasks

### Error Recovery
- `workflow_record_model_error` - Track model failures
- `workflow_get_available_model` - Get fallback model
- `workflow_get_resilience_status` - Check model health

### Quality & Assertions
- `workflow_add_assertion` / `workflow_verify_assertion` - Define and verify quality assertions
- `workflow_record_error_pattern` / `workflow_match_error` - Learn from and match error patterns
- `workflow_record_concern_outcome` / `workflow_get_agent_performance` - Track agent precision

### Git Worktree Support

Worktrees enable parallel `/crew` workflows in isolated directories. Available on all platforms:
- **Claude Code**: `/crew-worktree "task"` (slash command)
- **Copilot CLI**: `@crew-worktree "task"` (agent)
- **Gemini CLI**: `@crew-worktree "task"` (agent)

MCP tools (record metadata, return git commands — do not execute git directly):
- `workflow_create_worktree` - Record worktree metadata and get git commands to execute
- `workflow_get_worktree_info` - Check if a task has an active worktree
- `workflow_cleanup_worktree` - Mark worktree as cleaned and get cleanup git commands

The worktree branches from the current branch and `.tasks/` resolves back to the main repo via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`.

**Important behaviors:**
- **LF enforcement**: The `.git` pointer file and `gitdir` file are written with `printf` to guarantee LF line endings (CRLF breaks git on Windows/WSL).
- **Dependency installation**: Controlled by `worktree.install_deps` (`auto` | `never`). When `auto` (default), the agent auto-detects lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `requirements.txt`, etc.) and installs dependencies. Set to `never` to skip.
- **Copy settings**: `worktree.copy_settings` (default `true`) copies host CLI settings (e.g., `.claude/settings.local.json`) into the worktree so the new session inherits configuration.
- **Jira integration**: Config-driven via `worktree.jira`. `auto_assign` (`auto` | `prompt` | `never`) assigns the current user on worktree creation. `transitions` defines lifecycle hooks: `on_create` (worktree created), `on_complete` (workflow done), `on_cleanup` (worktree removed). Each hook has `to` (target status), `mode` (`auto` | `prompt` | `never`), and `only_from` (list of statuses — skip transition if current status isn't in this list, empty = always try). All degrade gracefully if the Jira MCP tool is unavailable.
- **Post-setup commands**: `worktree.post_setup_commands` (list of strings) runs arbitrary shell commands after the worktree is fully set up (after deps install). Commands support placeholders: `{worktree_path}`, `{task_id}`, `{branch_name}`, `{main_repo_path}`, `{jira_issue}`.
- **Task state path**: The final output includes the absolute path to `.tasks/TASK_XXX/` in the main repo and a prompt template that tells the new AI session where state lives. MCP tools resolve this automatically, but direct file reads should use the absolute path.
